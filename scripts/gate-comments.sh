# Comments describe code. They do not argue with it.
#
# A comment block may not exceed 20% of the lines of the implementation it describes. Measured per
# file, because a block belongs to the file it is in and an average over a crate hides a module
# header ten times the length of its re-exports.
#
# Two allowances, both narrow:
#
#   `SAFETY:` blocks do not count. An `unsafe` block is required to carry one, the requirement is
#   not this gate's to override, and the note has to say enough to be checked against.
#
#   A file may always have FLOOR comment lines, whatever its size. Twenty percent of a four-line
#   re-export module is not a sentence, and a module that cannot say what it is has been made
#   worse rather than tidier.
