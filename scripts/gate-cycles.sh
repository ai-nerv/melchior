# No cycles among a crate's top-level modules.
#
# `{asking, directory, identity, policy}` were a knot of three: asking resolved a name through
# directory while directory dialled through asking; identity asked the directory which names were
# taken while the directory was built out of identities; policy read a setting the directory
# owned while the directory asked policy what was allowed. Nothing said so. Every one of them
# compiles, and a cycle is the one shape that makes a module impossible to read on its own,
# impossible to test on its own, and impossible to move.
#
# **This is the gate Pi never built.** It built *reachability* — and a cycle is maximally
# reachable, which is why a reachability gate passes at 240,000 lines with the knot still in it.
# `magi/scripts/gate-reachable.sh` has the identical blind spot.
#
# Comments are stripped first, and this is not a detail: a module that documents its counterpart
# with `[`crate::directory::free_in`]` is describing the relationship, not depending on it. A
# gate that counted rustdoc links would have fired on the fix that removed the last real edge,
# which is the failure mode that gets a gate deleted in a week. `#[cfg(test)]` bodies go the same
# way -- a test may reach for anything, and one that does is not an architectural fact.
#
# POSIX for the same reason the others are: /bin/sh on the runner is dash.
# `GATE_ROOT` because the workspace siblings keep their sources in `crates`, not `src`.
