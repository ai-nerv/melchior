# straight past a trailing `remove_dir_all`. So a *failing* test always leaked, and the
# delete-then-create helpers only ever revisited their own name under their own pid, which never
# repeats. Thousands of directories accumulated across two renames of this project and nothing
# said so, because nothing looked.

# Run under a `TMPDIR` of its own, so the answer is about this run and not about whatever else
# the machine has in `/tmp`. That also means it can be trusted on a developer's laptop, which the
