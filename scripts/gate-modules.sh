# Every source file is reachable from its crate root.
#
# A .rs file nobody declares is not a compile error, not a warning, and not run -- it simply is
# not part of the crate. Two of them were found at once: `prompt/says.rs` and `keys/accept.rs`,
# each holding tests that had silently not run since the commit that moved them there. Both were
# a `mod` line an edit failed to add, and nothing anywhere would have said so.
#
# POSIX for the same reason the others are: /bin/sh on the runner is dash.
#
# `GATE_ROOT` for the single-crate repos. When it is `crates`, a file's crate root is the first
# two path components (`crates/<name>`); when the whole repo is one crate there is nothing to
# strip and the root is the search root itself.
