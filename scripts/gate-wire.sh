# The family speaks one way, and a sixth wire cannot invent a sixth spelling.
#
# Five wires had grown five ways to say the same thing: `say`/`heard` on melchior's pipe,
# `to`/`from` on the surface pipe, `message` on the tool-peer pipe, `said` on the streamed
# answer, and a call envelope on the sockets. Nothing anywhere said which was meant, and nothing
# could: each was internally consistent, and each was written by somebody who had not read the
# other four.
#
# **The failure is silent.** Two of those wires exist as byte-identical copies in two
# repositories -- the surface frames, and the streamed answer -- so when two spellings drift
# nothing fails and no test goes red. The surface simply stops being answered, and it presents
# much later as "that tool never draws".
#
# Two shapes only. A **call** is answered and carries a reply; an **event** is not. Every enum
# whose variants cross a process boundary is tagged `event`. The rule is written out in this
# repository's wire module.
#
# A **data** discriminator is a different thing: a tagged enum nested *inside* a message, which
# names a shape rather than an event. Those are allowed their own key, and each is listed below
# with why. The list is the point -- adding to it is a deliberate act, and a new wire that
# invents a tag is not on it.
#
# POSIX for the same reason the others are: /bin/sh on the runner is dash.
