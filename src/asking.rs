//! Reaching another instance.
//!
//! The other half of [`crate::serving`], and deliberately blocking. The caller is a tool peer
//! whose whole existence is one round trip — it has no UI to keep responsive and no turn to
//! yield to — and a blocking socket there is a dozen lines where an async one would be a
//! runtime, a spawn and a channel to carry the answer back out of it.
//!
//! # One connection, several calls
//!
//! [`Held`] stays open until it is dropped. Closing after each call is the tempting
//! simplification and it is the one the family's own guidance warns about: a client that holds a
//! connection is the obvious way to write one, and it dies on its *second* call with a broken
//! pipe. `list`, `status` on each of them, then `send` to one is four calls and one connection.
//!
//! # Every call says who is making it
//!
//! Not as courtesy — [`crate::answering`] refuses anything but `verbs` without it, because
//! every other verb is about that session and a stranger has no standing to ask. The name is
//! taken at face value; what it buys is a *relation*, which is read off the directory at the
//! far end and is not the caller's to claim.
