//! Telling the model an instance was named.
//!
//! `$iota-mu` in a prompt does not send anything. It appends a note saying that instance exists,
//! how it stands to this session, what has already passed between them, and that there is a tool
//! for reaching it — and then the model decides what "tell it to stop" meant and calls the tool,
//! or does not.
//!
//! That order matters and it is the whole design. A harness that delivered the message itself
//! would be deciding what the sentence meant: whether "ask $iota-mu about the parser" is a
//! question to relay, a plan to make first, or a thing to do after reading a file. Naming an
//! instance is a *fact given to the model*, exactly like naming a file is.
//!
//! What is appended is bounded and it is not a system prompt. It is the smallest thing that
//! turns a name into something callable: who they are, how they stand to you, whether they can
//! be reached at all, what has already been said, and the name of the tool.
