//! The family's framing: four bytes of length, then JSON.
//!
//! Not `axon_ipc`, which is what the UI and the daemon speak to each other. That is CBOR
//! inside an `Envelope` carrying a protocol version, and it is right for two halves of one
//! program that ship together — a peer from another build should be turned away at the
//! boundary rather than after its fields have been read.
//!
//! This socket is the opposite case. Anything may knock on it: another axon, a sibling tool,
//! somebody with `socat` working out why a message never arrived. So it speaks what the family
//! agreed and what [`crate::wire`] documents — a big-endian `u32`, then a JSON body, and
//! nothing wrapped around it.
//!
//! **This was the bug this file exists to fix.** The socket was framed with `axon_ipc` and
//! documented as JSON, which is the failure the family's own guidance names first: it works
//! perfectly when axon talks to axon, and no sibling can say a word to it. Nothing inside the
//! tool that owns it can see that — every test passes, both ends agree — and it presents much
//! later as "that peer never answers".
//!
//! Both a blocking and an asynchronous half, because the two ends really are different: the
//! listener lives in a UI that must not block, and the caller is a tool peer whose whole job is
//! one round trip.
