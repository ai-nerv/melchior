//! What one axon calls itself.
//!
//! `project/role/id` — the folder you are in, what this session is for, and which session it is.
//! Three parts because sessions talk to each other, and a name that says only "axon" answers
//! none of the questions a message arriving from one would raise: *whose* work, doing *what*,
//! and *which* of the several you have open.
//!
//! - **project** is the working directory's name, so it needs no configuration to be right. A
//!   `.axon.lua` may override it, and that is one of the few things a project file may say about
//!   itself: naming yourself carries no authority.
//! - **role** is what this session is for. `main` today; multi-agent will fill it.
//! - **id** tells two sessions in one directory apart. Two Greek words, because they are short,
//!   pronounceable over a desk, and there are enough of them.
//!
//! # The name and the address are not the same length
//!
//! The socket is `<project>/<id>` — no role — and that is deliberate rather than an oversight.
//! An id is already unique inside a project, so a role in the path would be a second key for the
//! same door, and a session that changed what it was for would move.
//!
//! So the role is what a session *says about itself*, and the id is where it *is*. Permission
//! never reads the role for the same reason: a session that could pick its own role could pick
//! `main` and claim a main's reach. What decides that is the tree — see
//! [`crate::policy`].
