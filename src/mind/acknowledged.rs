//! What is installed, what it was when you said yes, and what changed since.
//!
//! **The ten percent of a package manager that is worth having.** Fetching is `git clone`; the
//! idea is the lockfile. A manifest names every installed package file and the digest it had when
//! somebody acknowledged it, and a file whose digest does not match does not run.
//!
//! **Fail-closed, and only for what somebody else wrote.** A file in your own `plugin/` directory
//! is one you put there, and asking you to confirm your own configuration is a prompt nobody
//! reads — it trains people to say yes. A package under `site/pack/` is code that arrived by
//! being fetched and can change under you between one run and the next, which is the case where
//! an acknowledgement means something.
//!
//! So the answer to "is this new, or did it change" is never a warning that scrolls past. It is
//! the file not running, and a line saying which one and what to type.
