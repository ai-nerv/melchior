//! A wire protocol, described in Lua.
//!
//! The only implementation of [`Adapter`] there is. `magi-provider` owns the contract and moves
//! the bytes; every protocol — Anthropic's Messages, OpenAI's Completions, the eight others —
//! is a table of functions in `lua/apis/*.lua`, registered like anything else.
//!
//! A protocol is a description. Describing one should not need a rebuild, and a person with a
//! private endpoint that speaks something slightly different should be able to say so.
