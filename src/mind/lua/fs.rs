//! The directory lister the family's clients use to find each other.
//!
//! A sibling's client prefers `host.fs.ls(dir)` over shelling out to `io.popen`, because a
//! sandboxed host may refuse the latter. Offering it is what lets hexe's and oslo's clients
//! discover their own sockets while running inside magi.
//!
//! **`fs.dir` is deliberately not offered.** A client asks the host for "the directory my
//! sockets live in", and any host that answers gets believed — so magi answering would send
//! hexe's client looking for hexe sockets in magi's directory. Listing is generic and safe to
//! lend; naming your own runtime directory is not.
