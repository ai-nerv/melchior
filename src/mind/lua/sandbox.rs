//! What a config cannot reach.
//!
//! `Lua::full()` hands the VM the whole standard library, which includes `os.execute` and
//! `io.popen`. A Lua tool with those can spawn processes, and then the process transport is a
//! stylistic preference rather than the only way to run a command — which is the opposite of
//! the design. So they are removed.
//!
//! Removed rather than never installed, because the alternative is assembling a standard
//! library by hand and quietly missing something the next luna release adds. A short list of
//! what must not be reachable is auditable; a long list of what may be is not.
