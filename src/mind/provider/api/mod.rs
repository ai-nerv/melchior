//! One adapter per wire protocol.
//!
//! This is where vendor differences belong when they are too large for [`crate::mind::provider::compat`]: a
//! protocol has its own request shape and its own stream events, and no amount of flags makes
//! Anthropic's Messages API into OpenAI's Completions. Everything smaller than that is a
//! declaration in the catalog.
//!
//! Adapters are pure. `request` builds JSON, `on_event` folds one server-sent event into a
//! stream's state — no HTTP, no sockets, no clock. That is what lets every one of them be
//! tested against recorded bytes instead of a live account.
