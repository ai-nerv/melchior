//! Signing in to a subscription, rather than exporting a key.
//!
//! An API key is a string a person can put in their environment. A subscription is not: the
//! only way to hold one is a token you were given, that expires, and that has to be renewed
//! without asking again. That is the whole of the difference, and the whole of why this exists.
//!
//! **What is stored, and where.** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/magi/credentials.json`, mode `0600`, one
//! entry per provider. Not the system keyring: a keyring is a second daemon, a second failure
//! mode and a second thing to explain, and a file only the user can read is what every other
//! tool on the machine already uses for the same job. Never the journal — a transcript is
//! meant to be readable, copyable and shareable, which is exactly what a token must not be.
