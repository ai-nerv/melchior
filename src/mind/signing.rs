//! `melchior auth` — signing in to a subscription.
//!
//! The command exists because there is nothing to export. An API key is a string a person can
//! put in their shell profile; a subscription is a token you are given, that expires, and that
//! has to be renewed on your behalf. So "how do I enable this" has a command for an answer,
//! and this is it.
//!
//! The browser is opened rather than embedded. melchior has no business rendering a sign-in page,
//! the person's own browser already holds the session they are signing in with, and a terminal
//! program asking for a password is the shape of every credential-phishing attack there is.
