//! The contract for asking a mind a question — melchior's copy.
//!
//! The same shapes magi holds, written out again rather than shared. A sibling that depended on
//! a harness's crate to speak to it would be a component of that harness wearing a socket. The
//! wire is the contract; these are two implementations of it, and the tests on both sides are
//! what keep them one shape.
//!
//! magi does not talk to models. melchior does: it owns the protocols, the credentials and the
//! HTTP, and this is the vocabulary magi asks it in. Everything here is deliberately neutral
//! about *which* model — a card describes one, an [`Ask`] names one, and neither knows what a
//! provider is.
//!
//! # Two encodings, one shape
//!
//! Every type here is `Serialize + Deserialize` with no borrowed data and no untagged enums, so
//! the same value round-trips through JSON and through CBOR. JSON is what a person reads and
//! what a Lua sibling speaks — the family stub cannot decode CBOR. CBOR is what magi and
//! melchior use between themselves once neither needs to read it: it keeps byte strings and the
//! integer/float split that JSON flattens, and a signature is exactly the sort of opaque bytes
//! JSON would quietly mangle.
//!
//! Both are offered because neither is right everywhere, and a family whose members guess is a
//! family that fails on the first signature.
//!
//! # Streaming
//!
//! An [`Ask`] answers with many [`Said`], not one. The family socket is request and reply, so
//! the stream travels on melchior's pipe instead: one JSON object per line, in order, ending in
//! [`Said::Stop`] or [`Said::Failed`]. A caller that sees neither has lost the mind, which is
//! the only failure it must tell apart from a refusal.
