//! What a spawned helper said before it failed.
//!
//! melchior nulls the stderr of everything it starts, because a coordinator reads its stdout as
//! a protocol and a stray line from a child would land in the middle of it. The cost is that a
//! signing helper that is not installed and one that exited non-zero are the same empty answer.
//!
//! So the diagnosis goes to a file instead, and only when somebody asked for one.
//!
//! Deliberately not `tracing`. A handful of call sites do not justify a dependency, a
//! subscriber, an initialisation order and a second way to fail at start-up — and the siblings
//! may not depend on each other, so it would be four of them.
