//! Who may speak to whom.
//!
//! Two walls, and everything else is a setting.
//!
//! **The project wall.** A session can see and reach only what is inside its own project's
//! runtime directory. Not "should not" — cannot: the directory it lists and the directory it
//! dials are the one it belongs to, so an axon in `~/work/other` is not refused, it is not
//! there. Nothing in this file can turn that off, which is the point of putting it in the
//! filesystem rather than in a check.
//!
//! **The instance wall.** Inside a project, an *instance* is a main and the subagents it
//! started. A main is that instance's front door and is reachable by the other mains; the
//! subagents behind it are private, so `beta-nu`'s worker cannot be reached — or even
//! usefully named — by `alpha-rho`'s.
//!
//! ```text
//!   alpha-rho  <--->  beta-nu          two mains, two instances
//!      |                 |
//!      +- iota-mu        +- tau-chi     each main's own subagents
//!      +- zeta-pi        +- xi-phi
//! ```
//!
//! # What the setting moves
//!
//! The default is the tightest thing that still works: **mains talk to mains**, and a subagent
//! talks to whoever started it. That second one is not a peer relationship and no setting
//! governs it — a subagent that cannot report back to its parent cannot raise `attention` or
//! `trouble`, which is most of why it can speak at all.
//!
//! | `axon.agent_talk` | and also |
//! |---|---|
//! | `"mains"` *(default)* | — |
//! | `"instance"` | siblings: two subagents of the same parent |
//! | `"project"` | cousins, and a subagent reaching another instance's main |
//!
//! It only ever opens things. There is no level below `mains`, because a project where nothing
//! can talk is a project that did not need any of this.
