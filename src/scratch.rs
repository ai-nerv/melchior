//! A temporary directory that removes itself.
//!
//! **Every test here used to clean up on its last line.** A `let _ = remove_dir_all(&dir);` after
//! the assertions runs when the test passes and does not run when it fails: `assert!` unwinds
//! straight past it. So the directories a *failing* test left behind stayed, and the delete-then-
//! create helpers only ever revisited their own name under their own pid — which never repeats.
//! The tree filled up quietly, across two renames of this project, and nothing anywhere said so.
//!
//! The fix is the one the language already offers: own the directory, and let `Drop` do it. A
//! guard runs on the unwind as well as on the return, which is the case that was leaking.
//!
//! Here rather than in a testkit crate because there is no second crate to put it in: melchior
//! is one crate. The siblings each carry their own copy of this for the same reason the wire
//! types are duplicated — a shared crate would be a dependency between repositories.
