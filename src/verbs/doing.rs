//! Working out what a verb means, and then doing it.
//!
//! Split from [`super`] because the two halves fail differently. Deciding is pure — a name that
//! does not parse, a verb that needs a `message`, a wall this session is on the wrong side of —
//! and every one of those is worth a test that binds nothing. Doing it is a socket, and what
//! goes wrong there is that nobody is listening.
//!
//! The order matters. Everything decidable is decided *before* anything is dialled, so a model
//! that asked for something it may not have gets told what it may do instead of spending the
//! round trip finding out. The far end checks again — a caller is not to be trusted with its own
//! permissions — but by then the turn has already been paid for.
