//! What one instance says to another.
//!
//! **Mirrored on purpose.** Every axon both listens and dials, and both halves are these types:
//! a main agent asking a fork what it is doing, and the fork asking back, are the same frames
//! travelling the other way. There is no supervisor vocabulary and no worker vocabulary,
//! because the moment there were two an agent could be one but not the other, and a subagent
//! that cannot ask its parent a question is a subagent that has to guess.
//!
//! # The shape is the family's, not axon's
//!
//! ```text
//! -> {"call":"status","args":[]}
//! <- {"ok":true,"n":1,"result":[{"busy":false,…}]}
//! ```
//!
//! Four-byte big-endian length, then the body. `result` is a **list** and `n` says how long it
//! is, which matters more than it looks: hexe, oslo and aeon answer in exactly this shape, and a
//! sibling that unpacks a list would read a bare value as *nothing at all*. `session()` would
//! come back empty rather than wrong, and an empty answer looks like an empty session — so the
//! bug presents as "that peer has no state" for as long as it takes somebody to put `socat` on
//! the socket. It is settled here before either side ships.
//!
//! A refused call is a **reply**, not a dropped connection: `{"ok":false,"error":…}`. The caller
//! then sees axon's error rather than a transport error, and "no such call: nope" says what to
//! fix where "connection reset" does not.
